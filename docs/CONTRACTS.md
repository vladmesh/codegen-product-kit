# Framework contracts

## Core settings v1

Every backend generated from this template provides the versioned core settings contract:

- `POST /settings/get` accepts `SettingGet` and returns `SettingValue`.
- `POST /settings/set` accepts `SettingSet` and returns `SettingValue`.

All three generated schemas carry `contract_version: 1`. A value is identified by its declared
`key` and by an explicit `scope`: `product` stores one product-wide value, while `user` requires a
positive local `subject_id`. Values are JSON and never inferred from prose or environment variables.
The database uniqueness boundary is `(key, scope, subject_id)`, so writing the same effective JSON
value is idempotent and user-scoped values cannot overwrite another subject's value.

Only settings declared in an explicit `services/<service>/manifest.yaml` may be written. A v1
manifest has a Draft 2020-12 `settings_schema` object with named `properties` and
`additionalProperties: false`. It is loaded separately from `services/<service>/spec/*.yaml`;
legacy `services/*/spec/manifest.yaml` remains ignored. The supported schema form deliberately has
no top-level `required` or `$ref`: each setting is independently written and no schema source may be
resolved indirectly. Duplicate keys across service manifests are invalid.

`POST /settings/set` requires exactly one `X-Settings-Capability` value matching the generated
`SETTINGS_WRITE_CAPABILITY` secret. The header is intentionally absent from generated schemas and
OpenAPI. It must not be logged, included in LLM-facing data, or used as a product setting. Reads do
not carry this deployment capability.

Environment variables remain startup, connectivity, platform, and secret configuration. A value
derived from the Product Brief or intended for a user to change belongs in a manifest-declared
setting instead.
